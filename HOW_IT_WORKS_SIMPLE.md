# 🎯 Bad Offset Identifier Tool: How It Works (Explain to Anyone!)

## 🧒 **Like Explaining to a 5-Year-Old**

### **What Does the Bad Offset Identifier Tool Do?**
Imagine you have a huge box of 1000 video files of people doing sign language. Your job is to check if the timing alignment between different camera angles is correct. But going through 1000 videos one by one would take FOREVER!

The Bad Offset Identifier Tool is like having a super-smart helper that:
1. **Opens each video pair** 📹📹
2. **Takes pictures** at the optimal sign moment (47.5%) 📸
3. **Shows you side-by-side frames** from both camera angles 💻
4. **Lets you say "Accept ✅" or "Reject ❌"** with just one click
5. **Downloads your decision** and **auto-refreshes** for the next file! 📝

### **The Magic Midpoint Picture** 🎭
For each "GOOD" sign language gesture, we take a picture at:
- **47.5%** - The optimal moment when the gesture is most clear 👐

We show you the same moment from:
- **Video 1** - First camera angle
- **Video 2** - Second camera angle

This way, you can see if the timing alignment between cameras is correct!

## 🔧 **How the CSV Magic Works**

### **What is a CSV?** 📊
CSV = "Comma Separated Values" - it's like a super simple table that any computer can read:

```
filename,decision,timestamp,notes
video1.eaf,accept,2024-09-26T11:30:00,Good alignment
video2.eaf,reject,2024-09-26T11:35:00,Poor timing
```

### **Where Does the CSV Come From?** 📍
**Location:** `/Users/nj/Projects/BadOffsetIdentifier/decisions.csv`

**When it appears:**
1. 🚀 **First run**: CSV file is created automatically (empty at start)
2. 👆 **Every click**: When you click "Accept ✅" or "Reject ❌", it adds a new line
3. 📱 **Real-time**: Updates immediately - no waiting!
4. 💾 **Always saved**: Even if you close your browser, decisions are saved forever

### **CSV Generation Process (Step by Step):**

```python
# Step 1: Program checks if CSV exists
if no csv file:
    create new file with headers: filename,decision,timestamp,notes

# Step 2: User clicks Accept/Reject button
user clicks "Accept" on "BF01F28WDC.eaf"

# Step 3: Program writes to CSV immediately
BF01F28WDC.eaf,accept,2024-09-26T11:30:00,Good alignment

# Step 4: Next time program runs
program reads CSV and skips BF01F28WDC.eaf (already done!)
```

## 🚀 **For Your Supervisor - Technical Questions**

### **Q: "How does the CSV generation work technically?"**
**A:**
- Uses Python's built-in `csv` module
- Creates file on first run with headers: `filename,decision,timestamp,notes`
- Each user click triggers `record_decision()` function
- Function appends new row immediately (no batching)
- File is written atomically (can't corrupt)

### **Q: "Where do the video frames come from?"**
**A:**
- FFmpeg extracts frames at specific timestamps
- Multi-point sampling: 30%, 45%, 65%, 80% through each annotation
- Frames encoded as Base64 and embedded in HTML (self-contained)
- No external dependencies needed to view results

### **Q: "How does resume functionality work?"**
**A:**
- Before processing any file, system reads entire CSV
- Creates lookup dictionary: `{'filename.eaf': 'accept/reject'}`
- Skips any file already in dictionary
- Only processes unreviewed files

### **Q: "Performance optimization?"**
**A:**
- Target: 50 files/hour (72 seconds per file)
- Batch processing reduces overhead
- Keyboard shortcuts (Alt+A/Alt+R) eliminate mouse clicks
- Auto-scroll to next file reduces navigation time
- Frames pre-extracted and embedded (no network requests)

### **Q: "Error handling?"**
**A:**
- Missing video files: Graceful skip with log message
- Corrupted EAF files: Try-catch blocks with error logging
- FFmpeg failures: Fallback to placeholder frames
- CSV corruption: Backup and rebuild functionality

## 🎯 **Why This Solves the Problem**

**Before Bad Offset Identifier Tool:**
- ⏰ Manual video playback: 5 minutes per file
- 🧠 No memory of what's been checked
- 📱 Inconsistent checking criteria
- 😴 Getting tired leads to mistakes

**After Bad Offset Identifier Tool:**
- ⚡ 72 seconds per file (4x faster!)
- 🧠 Perfect memory - never check same file twice
- 📏 Consistent midpoint sampling method
- 😊 Clean interface with auto-refresh reduces fatigue

**Result: 1000 files goes from 83 hours to 20 hours of work!** 🎉
